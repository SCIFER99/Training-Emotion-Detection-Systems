# Training-Emotion-Detection-Systems
This program consists of a Emotion Detection Training System written in Python! 

As per my Python development career, I am proud to say I have successfully developed an entire Emotion Detection System 
with Training component! A wise company once said,

1) "It doesn't matter what you identify yourself, as long as you bring your expertise to the table, you're good to go! *Google*
2) "A true expert of a programming language lies in knowing how to manually troubleshoot and debug a program." *Google*

I can honestly say I have troubleshot (past tense) and debugged this system and it worked! 

There are a lot of packages needed to be installed in order to successfully execute this system:

     pip3 install torch
     pip3 install tensorflow
     pip3 install numpy
     pip3 install pandas
     pip3 install argparse
     pip3 install transforms
     pip3 install sklearn
     pip3 install metrics
     pip3 install datetime
     pip3 install datasets
     pip3 install matplotlib
     
***Note: As of right now, Machine Learning in Python can only be built on versions between 3.7-3.9.
I am sure that will change in the near future! 

Happy Coding!
